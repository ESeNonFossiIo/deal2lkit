subsection deal2lkit::ParsedQuadrature<2>
  # In one space dimension, the given base formula is copied and scaled onto a
  # given number of subintervals of length 1/repetitions. In more than one
  # space dimension, the resulting quadrature formula is constructed in the
  # usual way by building the tensor product of the respective iterated
  # quadrature formula in one space dimension.
  set Number of repetitions  = 1

  # The number of quadrature points in each coordinate direction. (Avaible
  # only for gauss otherwise it should be 0)
  set Quadrature order       = 0

  # Quadrature rule:
  # gauss|midpoint|milne|simpson|trapez|weddle
